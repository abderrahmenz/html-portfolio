    Yet i'm still new to programmnig i don't know much of it but i could say I'm still learning and I bet that I would be <strong>the best Web Developer out there.</strong></p>
<h3>Future Plans:</h3>
<p>So I really don't like programming that much though, but I'm only learning it beacuse I see it as the only hope left for.<br />
And that's because as you know that I'm only interested in Medicine,
 so that's why I'm learning Web Develoment in order to collect money in 2-3 years and then i could study Medicine</p>
