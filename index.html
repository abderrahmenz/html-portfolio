    <img src="./Photos/231325.jpg" height="400" width="300">
    <p>Hello there, I'm pleased to learn that you want to get to know me a bit better.<br />
        As mentioned, my name is Abderrahmen, and I'm currently exploring the field of Web Development.<br />
        While I'm still in the early stages of my programming journey and don't possess extensive knowledge,<br />
        I can confidently say that I'm dedicated to learning. I'm optimistic that with time and effort, <b>I will become an accomplished web developer.</b></p>
<h3>Future Plans:</h3>
<p>So, I don't particularly enjoy programming, but I'm learning it because I see it as my only remaining option.<br />
    As you know, my true interest lies in Medicine. Therefore, I'm pursuing Web Development to generate income over the next 2-3 years,
    with the ultimate goal of funding my studies in Medicine.</p>
